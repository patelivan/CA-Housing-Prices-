# Why is California housing so costly? Comparing pricing disparities, economic trends, and public policy across states. A spatial approach

Median home prices in CA continue to increase, which makes it harder for people to buy and afford homes (Khouri, 2019). More importantly, the state's ability to attract talented workers from other parts of the U.S has decreased. Although businesses and people are not satisfied with CA's high taxes, I expect Housing to play a significant role in people's decisions to stay in or move out of CA (Malas, 2019). 
Some, such as the California Association of Realtors have shown housing prices are high that because of tighter supply as permits of new housing units has not kept up with HCD estimates (Young, p.46-55), and new jobs (Young, p.48). Thus, it is not a surprise that people making $100,000 or less have migrated out of CA (Young, p.68, and p.70). 

## What predicts median home values?

Through the years 1990-2019, using a regression estimation, I intend to examine housing price disparities across CA census tracts. The dependent variable will be the 2019 median home prices of a census tract, and independent variables will be the distance to a major metropolitan area, distance to the ocean, risks of environmental hazards, unemployment rate, population, and other essential neighborhood characteristics.

The purpose is to observe how much of the median home price is explained by the set of independent variables and why some areas are more expensive than others.

## Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis

Similar to Anderson and Elliot (2006), my project will also examine at post-1990 trends by CA’s census-tracts such as average annual number of single-family home purchases, patterns in homebuyer income v home values by census tract, and average home value home-purchase growth rate. I will use a census of all mortgage financial transactions that occurred at federally regulated institutions in the nation from 1990 release by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC).  

## Analyzing the economic trends

### Affordability: Exploratory Data Analysis of Home Prices and Income in California and other states. 

In Case and Shiller (2003), the authors calculate the ratios of home price to annual income per capita for fifteen states to understand price volatility.  The main question in the section is that by looking at the quarterly data from 1985-2002, what is the relationship between annual income per capita, and other state fundamental variables (mortgage interest rates, unemployment rate, population) and home prices (repeat-sales price) over time. It then calculates the R2 of regression of home prices on income per capita and the other fundamental variables (Table 1).

This project intends to begin with a similar analysis by looking at CA quarterly data from 2002-2019 to understand how prices have moved in line with income. Just like Case and Shiller (2003), I intend to calculate the ratio of median home prices and median per capita income by census tract. The purpose is to compare the affordability of CA with that of Texas, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington because those were the states Californians left for in 2018 (Lansner, 2019).

## Other Economic Trends.

What is CA’s economic outlook? How strong has job growth, unemployment, consumption, GDP been over the years? How does this compare to other states that Californians are moving to (different countries)?

## Public Policy

Why did CA cities not issue the needed permits? Why was the number of building permits different in other states? Were there any other factors that led to houses not being built in CA over the years? Are there alternative explanations of the housing trends?
